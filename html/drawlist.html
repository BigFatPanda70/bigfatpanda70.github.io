			<h1>Creating a canvas based 3D game.</h1>
			<p>8th April 2020</p>
			<p>First, a little background as to why this sort of thing is still required. A few years back, lots of people, myself included,  were creating 'WebGL' based software, which is the web version of OpenGL - the industry standard programming interface for rendering 3D graphics</p>
			<p>Along with everyone else, I was also loving the new powerful way to render 3D in the browser using full hardware acceleration. Your graphics could look better and they would render <i>faster</i>. For those of us who like writing high performance graphics software it was a really something to have this available in a web browser. 
			Then one day, my development pc died and I had to switch to my backup machine,  almost identical in spec, but with a slightly different graphics card. </p>
			<p>Nothing worked.</p>
			<p>The browser would say webgl was available, but disabled. To my dismay, despite lots of googling, it appeared my graphics card was no longer supported, and their was no fix for this other than buy a new pc. That would solve my problem, but I could never guarantee that other people using my software would not have the same issues I faced. </p>

			<h3> Canvas to the rescue.</h3>

			<p>Fortunately, even without the hardware acceleration of webgl, the HTML 5 canvas technology is <u>awesome</u> and is really, <i>really</i> good at rendering 2D graphics <i>very fast</i> and a modern javascript engine is also very fast, so I decided to go back to an old way of doing 3D graphics, one that was used to great effect on the  Playstation One and Sega Saturn. - using a drawlist</p>
			<p>Most 3D rendering software works with triangles and although there is no specific triangle drawing function available in canvas (what a missed opportunity!!) the tools available can still do this at an eye watering speed. </p>
			
				<div class="codeblock_container">
				<div class="codeblock">
					<code>
					// e.g. draw a simple red, filled triangle of 3 points (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) using canvas.<br>
					<br>
					canvas.beginPath();<br>
					canvas.fillStyle="#ff0000";<br>
					canvas.moveTo (x0,y0);<br>
					canvas.lineTo (x1,y1);<br>
					canvas.lineTo (x2,y2);<br>
					canvas.lineTo (x0,y0);<br>
					canvas.fill();<br>
					<br>
					</code>
				</div>
				<br>
					Performance note : constant changing/setting of either fillStyle or strokeStyle can make your rendering run slowly as the browser has to parse and check it each time it changes.
				</div>
			<h3> The Painters algorithm</h3>
			<p>This is one of the simplest solutions to the problem of rendering 3D graphics on a 2D canvas. The idea is that everything you want to draw is assigned a z value. The further into the background something is, the bigger the z value. By assigning everything a z value, and then drawing in z order (from largest to smallest) you can render a 3D scene.</p>
			<p>For ordering 3D triangles, the 'z' value for each triangle is the average z of each triangle corner. This works surprisingly well for a large number of cases. </p>
			<p>However, the painters algorithm has a few shortcomings in that it doesn't completely solve the drawing order problem or a number of cases, such as overlapping  z values. I'm using it here because it is a) fast and b) the memory footprint is relatively small compared to other solutions.</p>

			<p>My implementation of the painters algorithm involves creating a draw list, after doing the various 3D calculations to position all the triangles etc.. and then going through a simple loop to draw everything.</p>
			
						<p>
				<code>
					b = ((object_z - near_z) * MAXBUCKETS) / (far_z - near_z);<br>
					b = Math.floor(b);
					</code>
			</p>

			<h3> A fast Javascript draw list implementation</h3>
			
			<h2> Why use a draw list</h2>
			<p> Most modern smartphones, tablets and pc's can easily handle full 3D with a hardware z buffer. However some pc's, although capable of 3D rendering 
			have 3D rendering disabled in the browser. So you need a fallback to another way of ordering your 3D triangles.</p>
			<p>The way I see it, you have two options either do a software z-buffer, or create a draw list which will render your 
			triangle data in the right order for drawing (draw furthest away first).</p>  			
			<p>A quick note on the coordinate system used: y is up and down, x is left to right, z goes <i>into</i> the screen.
			The z axis is the opposite from the one used by opengl, but I find it more natural to have my positive z values go into the screen </p>
			<p> triangles are to be sorted on z value. To get the z-sort value, just find the average 
			<p>Ordering triangles by z values means that there needs to be a way to sort triangle data fast. To achieve this I've used 2 data structures.</p>
			<p>the first one is a 'bucket' list, which is a fixed size array, and all the z values between the near and far clip planes 
			are scaled to fit within this range.</p>
			<p>
				<code>
					b = ((object_z - near_z) * MAXBUCKETS) / (far_z - near_z);<br>
					b = Math.floor(b);
					</code>
			</p>
			<p> b will be an integer in the range from 0 to the maximum number of 'buckets'. This means that every triangle with similar z values will be grouped together. 
			  
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			
			<h2> Why not to use a draw list</h2>
			<p> A draw list will solve a limited set of rendering problems. With careful design of 3D objects it is perfectly
			possible to write 3D renderers with them. However, it is not a complete solution to the painters algorithm problem -
			overlapping triangles, or triangles close together will still not be rendered properly.
