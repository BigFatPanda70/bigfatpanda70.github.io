			<h1> Tech stuff:</h1>

			<h2> z ordering issues. </h2>
			<p> Rather than write a relatively simple version of breakout, I thought I'd be clever and go full 3D with this one.</p>
			<p>The problem is that I've used the same projection matrix that I'd use for opengl based 3D rendering, which uses a 
			coordinate system so that the z axis comes 'out' of the screen (negative z into the screen, positive z outwards) but using 
			the reverse coordinate system for everything else..</p>
			<p>I am using a html canvas to draw all the triangles which means there is no z buffer to do per pixel depth checks. 
			 This means I have to use a draw list buffer to order all the triangles before drawing. It sounds like a lot of extra work 
			 but modern pc's are fast enough to handle the overhead with a bit of creative buffer use without slowing to a crawl. </p>
			<p> My drawing buffer orders things in positive z order. So small z values (near the screen) are drawn last, while large z 
			values (far, far away) are drawn first.</p>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2> Avoiding WebGL like the Coronovirus... </h2>
			<p>Don't get me wrong.. I <u>like</u> WebGl.. it's a cool technology for doing modern 3D rendering in a browser. and that is <i> very cool</i> but..</p>
			<p>The thing is, sometime last year, people started blacklisting various older graphics cards, so that webgl just won't run anymore. I'd invested a lot of time 
			on it and suddenly none of my code would run. </p>
			<p>Which is annoying as I've got a perfectly good pc which will run OpenGl (another cool 3D tech). I only want to be able to draw 
			stuff, use a z buffer and texture mapping. Is it too much just to allow <i>some</i> sort of 3D browser rendering? </p>
			<p>So for the bat n ball project, I've abandoned webgl for now, and using good ol' reliable html 5 canvas, which seems to run just
			fine thanks on my old and creaky hardware. </p>
