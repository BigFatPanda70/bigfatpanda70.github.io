	<p>Note: This software is a personal project to recreate a game I 
	loved to play in the arcades as a kid. It is an attempt to create 
	a playable reproduction of the hardware and software. 
	It uses the original ROMS from the arcade machine, so
	it is not for sale or general distribution The roms have
	<b><u>not</u></b> been released into the public domain and I don't
	have any rights regarding them. (I've asked.. but as yet had no
	 reply.).

	<p>The emulator is not 100% perfect, I still have some issues with 
	colour palettes and some hardware screen scrolling issues but it is
	mostly playable.</p>
	
	<h3>Controls:</h3>
	<p><u>Keyboard:</u><br>
	arrow keys to move<br>
	5 to insert coins<br>
	1 to start player one game<br>
	2 to start player two game<br>
	s to throw ball</p>

	<p><u>Joystick Support:</u><br>
	Most standard joysticks should work (including PS4 controllers).
	</p>

	<p><u>Touchscreens</u><br>
	Right hand side of the screen : throw ball.<br>
	Left hand side: swipe and hold to move up,down,left and right.<br>
	Use the hamburger menu icon (grey, 3 lines top right) to add coins
	and start the game.

<!--	<h3><u>Development notes (for Nerds!):</u></h3>
	<p>Mr Do was first released by Universal way back in 1982, and has
	been a favorite of mine ever since I first encountered it in the
	arcades.</p>
	<p>Over the years I've played various versions of it, including 
	a version in the MAME arcade emulator which faithfully runs the 
	original arcade version using the original software.</p>
	
	<p>Unfortunately, over the years, MAME has become a somewhat large
	project which requires quite a lot of resources to run these days 
	and I wanted to be able to play Mr Do on a small mobile device.</p>
	
	<p>The emulator source code is relatively easy to find online, so
	around three years ago (2017) I looked at whether I could adapt the
	code to create a small emulator of my own.	Other people have 
	written emulators, so how hard could it be ? </p>
	
	<p>Well it turns out that it is very hard actually and quite a long
	process. I've had to port (and upgrade) my z80 emulator which was 
	originally written in java (for a sinclair spectrum emulator)
	and convert it to javascript. The languages are similar but just
	 different enough to cause a lot of hard to find bugs. The z80
	 instruction set is huge (1000+  instructions), and there are a
	 <b>lot</b> of undocumented instructions that need to be emulated 
	 and tested</p>

	<p>The Mr Do hardware itself is also not very well documented
	anywhere, so I've had to do a lot of reading of various emulator
	sources in order to figure things out. Some of the source
	code is itself quite cryptic, which hasn't helped. When I get 
	chance, I will try and create some proper hardware docs. 
	The emulator still isn't perfect, as I've got some colour issues
	and a few problems with the screen scrolling hardware.</p>
	<h3>Screen emulation</h3>
	<p>The game screen is composed of two overlayed canvas screens
	that are scaled to fit the entire browser window. I've used an
	in memory buffers for the screens, and left the actual
	display to the hardware as much as possible.  </p>
