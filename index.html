<title>Website v2.0 : Games, Wordsearch Generator, Facts for quizzes, ask alexa</title>
<!--

	Title	:	HTML Index Page version 2.0
	
	Info	:	Version 2.0	28th April 2020
	
	Author	:	Nick Fleming
	
	Updated	:	27th May 2020
	
	 Notes:
	----------
		Didn't like the look of the first attempt. It was functional
	but screamed "1990's" free website design.
	
	So .. trying again.. sigh..
	

	first things first.. need the footer to always be at the bottom
	of the page.

	also.. need the cookie popup to appear as usual.

	 7th May 2020
	--------------
	Trying to find a font size/width that looks good and readable.
	
	so.. need a grid design of sorts, so that we have a left column
	that gets hidden on smaller screens,
	a middle area that is sort of fixed in width (80em maybe)? and
	a right hand side that has some images / links perhaps.

	what a pain !!

		updating the 'ask alexa' bits.

				<h2>Bat'n'Ball</h2>
				<p>This is a simple breakout style game at its heart but I wanted to do something slightly different so, for a challenge, I wrote it using a small 3D engine, which I will be using for other projects in the near future.</p>
				<p> I've had it tested it across a range of gadgets, so hopefully it will work on whatever hardware you have to hand.</p>

				<h2>Base64 Encoder</h2>
				<p>Web browsers have a <b>lot</b> of security features built in, which made it impossible to load images/textures without turning off security features. To get around the cross origin resource sharing
				restrictions (CORS) when testing locally, I found base64 encoding images to be a workable solution</p>
				<p>I've uploaded it here in case anyone else finds it useful.	<a href="./html/image_b64.html">Base64 Encoder Click here</a> </p>

				<h2>Wordsearch Generator</h2>
				<p>This little project generates unique wordsearches that can be printed out (I've not got round to doing an online version yet).</p>
				<p>If you are stuck for ideas or just don't like typing I've provided quite a few word lists to get you started as well.</p>
