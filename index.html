			<h1> Hello World !</h1>
			<h2> News: </h2>
			<br>
			<p>13th March 2020: Unless you've been living under a rock, you will be aware of a world wide pandemic.. hope everyone stays safe and well at this difficult time.</p>
			<br>
			<u>Please accept my apologies.. this site is under major construction.</u>
			
			<p>Ok.. so.. on day one.. I've got the google analytics thing up and running, so right from the start I can track how many people (if any!) visit this site.</p><br>
			<u> 10th March 2020:</u></br>
			<br>
			A few teething troubles.. had an issue with a media query but its working right now.
			<br>
			doing some testing with canvas resizing.. so that games will run in the largest 
			possible window.
			<br>
			<br>
			<u> 13th March 2020:</u><br>
			Starting to get things together now, still trying to get a game up, but having some
			 technical issues with the maths. Trying to at least update stuff once a day to keep
			 the momentum going.
			<br>
			<br>
			To Do :
			<br>
			1) finish game
			<br>
			2).. add google ad's to help pay for all this and a bag of chips.
			<br>
			3) links to github project.
			<br>
