			<h1> A fast Javascript draw list implementation</h1>
			<h2> Why use a draw list</h2>
			<p> Most modern smartphones, tablets and pc's can easily handle full 3D with a hardware z buffer. However some pc's, although capable of 3D rendering 
			have 3D rendering disabled in the browser. So you need a fallback to another way of ordering your 3D triangles.</p>
			<p>The way I see it, you have two options either do a software z-buffer, or create a draw list which will render your 
			triangle data in the right order for drawing (draw furthest away first).</p>  			
			<p>A quick note on the coordinate system used: y is up and down, x is left to right, z goes <i>into</i> the screen.
			The z axis is the opposite from the one used by opengl, but I find it more natural to have my positive z values go into the screen </p>
			<p> triangles are to be sorted on z value. To get the z-sort value, just find the average 
			<p>Ordering triangles by z values means that there needs to be a way to sort triangle data fast. To achieve this I've used 2 data structures.</p>
			<p>the first one is a 'bucket' list, which is a fixed size array, and all the z values between the near and far clip planes 
			are scaled to fit within this range.</p>
			<p>
				<code>
					b = ((object_z - near_z) * MAXBUCKETS) / (far_z - near_z);<br>
					b = Math.floor(b);
					</code>
			</p>
			<p> b will be an integer in the range from 0 to the maximum number of 'buckets'. This means that every triangle with similar z values will be grouped together. 
			  
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2> Why not to use a draw list</h2>
			<p> A draw list will solve a limited set of rendering problems. With careful design of 3D objects it is perfectly
			possible to write 3D renderers with them. However, it is not a complete solution to the painters algorithm problem -
			overlapping triangles, or triangles close together will still not be rendered properly.
